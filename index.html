    <h3>Next Best Offer Recommender System</h3>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Developed a customer-centric recommendation platform for a major bank, 
    adapting Andrea Fabrizi’s (2014) Next Best Offer framework. Since real customer data was unavailable due to NDA, 
    synthetic data was generated to validate the approach.</p>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Designed and implemented recommendation pipelines, 
    built propensity models, and created synthetic datasets for testing.</p>
    <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python, PyTorch, Pandas, Scikit-learn.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Enabled accurate product recommendations in an environment 
    with limited data, supporting customer engagement strategies.</p>
