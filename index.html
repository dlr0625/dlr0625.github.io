    <h3>An Integrated Approach to Next Best Offer Modeling for Financial Products: A Multi-Model Architecture</h3>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Designed and implemented a centralized NBO system for a major bank to 
  deliver automated, customer-centric product offers. The framework combined 
  customer similarity, product similarity, and XGBoost propensity modeling, 
  tested through leave-one-out and temporal validation. An ensemble approach 
  was also explored, showing marginal improvements over the strongest models.</p>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Model development and Evaluation</p>
    <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost.</p>
